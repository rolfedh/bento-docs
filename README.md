## Just follow the instructions

* Bento-docs is a simple step-by-step method for documenting software.
* Almost anyone can do it. You certainly can.

### Words of encouragement

If you find writing docs difficult and tend to get stuck, say the following phrases out loud to yourself:

* Having some docs is better than having none.
* We have to start somewhere.
* First drafts are about discovery.
* Our first drafts are going to **stink**; they always do.
* Writing is thinking. Revising is refining.
* To improve our docs, we will revise them.
* Questions and comments from readers/users are scary. Use them like fertilizer to improve your docs.

### If you get stuck

1. Give yourself a three-hour time box to work on a step.
2. Set an alarm to go off in three hours. (Really - do this.)
3. Work on the step until the time box ends. No extensions.
4. Move on to the next step.
5. **Continue until you complete the process**. Do not stop or reverse direction.

## Step #1: List your three most important user types or roles

* If you designed your software for specific user types or roles, make a list of the three most important ones.
* Sort these users by importance.

For example:

> 1. Administrator
> 2. System user
> 3. Standard user

* If there's only one user type, skip to step #2.

## Step #2

For each user,

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rolfedh/bento-docs/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rolfedh/bento-docs/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
