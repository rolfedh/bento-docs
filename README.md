## Just follow the instructions

* Bento-docs is a simple step-by-step method for documenting software.
* Almost anyone can do it. You certainly can.

## Words of encouragement

If you find writing docs difficult and tend to get stuck, this is for you:

* Your first drafts are going to **stink** because they always do.
* You've got to start somewhere.
* Having some docs is better than having none.
* They are going to get better with revisions.
* Writing is thinking. Revising is refining your thoughts out.
* You're going to get questions and comments from users. That's pure gold for improving your docs.

If you get stuck:

1. Set a time limit (several hours or days).
2. Do your best within that time limit.
3. Move on to the next thing and **continue until you complete the process**.

## Step #1: List your three most important user types or roles

* If you designed your software for specific user types or roles, make a list of the three most important ones.
* Sort these users by importance.

For example:

> 1. Administrator
> 2. System user
> 3. Standard user

* If there's only one user type, skip to step #2.

## Step #2
